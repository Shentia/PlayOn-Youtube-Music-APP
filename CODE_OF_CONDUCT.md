# Code of Engagement for Contributors

## Our Commitment

In the spirit of fostering an inclusive and safe environment, we, as members, contributors, and leaders, commit to making participation in our community welcoming for everyoneâ€”irrespective of age, body size, disabilities (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are dedicated to behaving and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, friendly, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Expected Behavior

Behaviors that contribute to a positive and welcoming community environment include:

* Displaying empathy and kindness towards others
* Showing respect for different opinions, perspectives, and experiences
* Offering and receiving constructive criticism graciously
* Taking responsibility for our actions, offering apologies to those we have impacted, and learning from our experiences
* Prioritizing what is beneficial for the community as a whole over individual interests

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, and trolling
* Harassment in public or private
* Disclosing others' private information without explicit consent
* Engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate in a professional setting

## Leadership Enforcement

Community leaders are tasked with clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They are expected to take appropriate and equitable corrective measures in response to any conduct they consider improper, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct, and to communicate moderation decisions when necessary.

## Applicability

This Code of Conduct is applicable in all community spaces and when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Representation of our community can be through activities like using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at events, whether online or offline.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community leaders at hello@playonworld.ca. All reports will be reviewed and investigated in a prompt and fair manner.

The privacy and security of the reporter of any incident are paramount for community leaders.

## Enforcement Measures

The following guidelines are used by community leaders to determine the consequences for actions deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Engaging in language or behavior that's unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written reprimand from community leaders, providing clarity around the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be required.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: A violation through a single instance or repeated actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with stipulated consequences for continued misbehavior. No interaction with the individuals involved, including unsolicited contact with those enforcing the Code, for a set period. Non-compliance may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact**: Severe breach of community standards, including sustained improper conduct.

**Consequence**: A temporary prohibition on any interaction or public communication with the community for a certain period. No interaction with the individuals involved is allowed during this time. Violations during this period may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Consequence**: A permanent prohibition on any public interaction within the community.
